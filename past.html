            <p id="mypast">Hi, I’m Zijun James Chen, a Computer Science (Honours) student at the University of Technology Sydney, specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. I’m passionate about building intelligent systems, solving real-world problems with code, and continuously improving my technical skills across multiple domains.</p>
            <p id="mypast">I have hands-on experience in deep learning, C++/Python development, and game engines, with projects ranging from a 3D ResNet-based lip-reading model to full game recreations and interactive systems in Unity and Roblox Studio. Game development has always been a huge part of what drives me. There’s something uniquely rewarding about bringing ideas to life, making systems interactive and fun, and crafting experiences that people can interact with and enjoy.</p>
            <p id="mypast">At my core, I’m motivated by learning through building. I love taking ambitious ideas, breaking them down, and iterating until they become polished, working systems. Whether I’m optimising a CNN, designing game logic, or refining a user experience, I take pride in every attempt I make, whether it is failures that push me to grow and successes that fuel my drive to keep improving.</p>
            <p id="mypast">I’m now seeking an internship where I can contribute to a team, grow as an engineer, and apply my skills to real-world software challenges. I bring strong problem-solving skills, a growth mindset, and genuine enthusiasm for creating things that work well, look good, and feel great to use.</p>
